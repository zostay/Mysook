Leviticus 19:9–18

“When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap your field right up
to its edge, neither shall you gather the gleanings after your harvest. And you
shall not strip your vineyard bare, neither shall you gather the fallen grapes
of your vineyard. You shall leave them for the poor and for the sojourner: I am
the LORD your God.

“You shall not steal; you shall not deal falsely; you shall not lie to one
another. You shall not swear by my name falsely, and so profane the name of your
God: I am the LORD.

“You shall not oppress your neighbor or rob him. The wages of a hired worker
shall not remain with you all night until the morning. You shall not curse the
deaf or put a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall fear your God: I
am the LORD.

“You shall do no injustice in court. You shall not be partial to the poor or
defer to the great, but in righteousness shall you judge your neighbor. You
shall not go around as a slanderer among your people, and you shall not stand up
against the life of your neighbor: I am the LORD.

“You shall not hate your brother in your heart, but you shall reason frankly
with your neighbor, lest you incur sin because of him. You shall not take
vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall
love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD. (ESV)
